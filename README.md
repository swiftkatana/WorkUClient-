## WorkU Application 
An application created for the convenient management of working from home. This app creates a comfortable environment for both employees working from home, and for employers managing remotely. It organizes information for both the employer and the employee, and allows a workplace to maintain clear communication and management -- even from a distance. 

### So what does the app entail?

#### For the employer: 
Creating “vocal tasks” for the employees, and tracking their progress and execution.
Managing employee requests quickly and conveniently. 
Viewing the hourly report of each employee, at any given moment. 
Ability to send payslips directly to the employees. 
Easy and convenient management of weekly shifts. 
Simple viewing of employees’ data.

#### For the employee: 
A “work clock” that automatically updates the hours worked in the monthly hours report. 
Ability to send requests to the employer in a convenient manner. 
Simple way of submitting shift requests to the employer, and easily viewing each week’s shifts. 
Access to viewing all payslips.

#### Creating “vocal tasks:” 
This application allows the employer to open a task room for the employee, which will be managed by “vocal updates” in order to keep both employer and employee on the same page. The task room operates with notification alerts, in order to ensure that no new information is missed. When the employee finishes the assigned task, an alert will be sent to the employer, and the task room will be automatically closed. There is no limit to the amount of task rooms -- the employee can simultaneously be in as many task rooms as the employer would like to assign.

#### Automatic “work clock:”
The application automatically updates all the employees’ work hours into the monthly hours report. At any given moment, the employer has access to and can see each employees’ “work clock” in order to get a picture of the employees’ presence.

#### Shift management: 
Employees can conveniently submit their preferred shifts and schedules to the employer, clearly marking which shifts they are unavailable to commit to. This information is presented to the employer in a simple and convenient way -- right on the smartphone screen, where it is easily managed. After the employer finalizes the shifts, both the employer and the employee have access to the clear shift schedule.

#### App personalization:
The application can be tailored by each user to fit his or her work environment. The application colors can be changed and reset based on personal preference, adding an extra touch of fun to a work day. 

This application ensures the success of every workplace, especially when it is run remotely. Quick, clear organization and easy access between the employer and employees, in an interactive and user-friendly application, makes work from home that much more fun.

## Installation
#### Just be aware that the first request sent to the server may take some time because the heroku server falls asleep so as soon as you send the request it turns on

In order to access all that the application offers, you are required to grant the application access to your microphone and turn on notifications. 

For the best user experience, it is recommended to use a hand-held device. The microphone proximity, along with the real-time notification alerts, will keep you fully engaged with your work environment. 

#### Functions that are still in development:
- viewing and sending payslips 
- viewing shifts (please note that requesting and managing shifts is already up and running)
